# EmployeeDirectory

The EmployeeDirectory app creates a employee directory using React. It will allow anybody to view the company's entire employee directory, with  quick access to their information.  

This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

# Motivation 
Homework 19 

# Prerequisites
The software will run in any Laptop, iPad and phone.

# Results
Application's UI was broke up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
When the app loads, a cover page renders with a navigations bar with links to the full directory, the sorted direectory and the search page, where a specific employee's information will be rendered. So, the user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by employee's first name.
  * Filter the users by full name (needs to be the exact full name).
